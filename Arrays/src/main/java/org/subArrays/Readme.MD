The total number of subarrays in an array of size N is N * (N + 1) / 2.
Subsequence
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Consider strings “geeksforgeeks” and “gks”. 
“gks” is a subsequence of “geeksforgeeks” but not a substring. 
“geeks” is both a subsequence and subarray. Every subarray is a subsequence. More specifically, Subsequence is a generalization of substring.

GEEKSFORGEEKS

GEEKSGEEKS is a subsequence but not a Subarray.
GEEKS is both subsequence and Subarray.
